Join us at the [Fedora House]({{ root_url }}/venue) for a preview of Fedora 4. 

This February 11th and 12th, we’re opening our doors for two evenings of Chicago deep-dish pizza, craft beer and code. We want to share what we’ve been hacking on and we’d like for you to join us. We want your input about what you want from Fedora 4. Pull requests welcome.

We’ll have committers from the Hydra, Islandora, Blacklight and Fedora projects on hand to answer any questions. [Register]({{ root_url }}/programme) to attend and you'll be entered into our raffle for prizes including beer from Three Floyds and some special bottles hand-carried from New York and Germany.
