Join the fedora4lib Developer Challenge at code4lib!

From now until 10am Thursday, 14 February, we're accepting submissions for the 
fedora4lib Developer Challenge.

Your starting point, clone: [https://github.com/futures/fcrepo4](https://github.com/futures/fcrepo4)

We very much believe that "The coolest thing to do with your data will be thought of by someone else", 
but here are some ideas we've been playing with, which you could fork and run with:

* Indexing services
	* A [4Store-based RDF indexing service](https://github.com/futures/ff-indexer-fourstore)
	* A [Solr 4 indexing service](https://github.com/futures/ff-jms-solr-indexing)
* Sequencers
    * Amazon Glacier Storage Service
* APIs
	* CDL storage service API implementation

Prizes to be awarded on Thursday include a $500.00 first prize, a $250.00 second prize, plus bottles from our [prize list]({{ root_url }}/brews)).

For more information, visit us at [Fedora House]({{ root_url }}/programme) on Monday and Tuesday nights!

The APIs: TBA. Currently, we have the legacy Fedora 3.x APIs implemented and a subset of the CDL Storage Service APIs stubbed out.

The Architecture: TBA.
