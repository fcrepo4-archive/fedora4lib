Fedora 4 is still very much a work-in-progress. We're very deliberately not going dark for months and months only to do a big reveal to the community. Even in these very early stages we're looking to the wider development community to validate our experiments.

Part of enabling that frequent and early validation from the community was to implement support for Hydra and Islandora applications--our two fastest growing communities of Fedora users. It's still a bit rough on the edges, but you can run a Hydra or Islandora application against fcrepo4 right now.

With Hydra & Islandora support as our touchstone, we are now freeing ourselves to break things and start on the fun stuff of getting Fedora 4 to do the things Fedora 3.x couldn't do or wouldn't do terribly well.

We've been testing and evaluating a number of candidate platforms to build and extend from for Fedora 4. Our leading candidate to date is ModeShape, a JCR implementation from JBoss.

ModeShape offers...[hierarchical data model, etc. etc.]

ModeShape builds on Infinispan...[linear scalability...etc etc]
