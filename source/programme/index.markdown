We have two nights planned for Fedora House, plus informal evening socials for the remainder of code4lib.

We'll have Chicago deep-dish pizza and a selection of local and not-so-local craft beers on Monday and Tuesday.

Bring your laptop, questions, and projects. Pull requests welcome.

During the week of code4lib, we're holding a [Developer Challenge]({{ root_url }}/hack) to get folks hacking on and around Fedora 4. Cash prizes of $500 and $250 will be awarded and the top three entries will also receive a special bottle from our [holdings]({{root_url}}/brews).
