We have two nights planned for Fedora House, plus informal evening socials for the remainder of code4lib.

We'll have Chicago deep-dish pizza and a selection of local and not-so-local craft beers on Monday and Tuesday.

Bring your laptop, questions, and projects. Pull requests welcome.

With a little bit of luck, we'll also be able to offer registered attendees $100 of free AWS credit from the nice folks at Amazon (no promises yet!). We'll update this page when we know for sure. So register below!
